# Git Push After Edits

After making any edits to this project, always push the changes to GitHub:

1. Stage all changes: `git add .`
2. Commit with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "Brief description of changes"`
3. Push to origin: `git push`

Do this in the same turn as the edits, before responding to the user.
